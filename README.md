## Executive summary
### Overview of Findings
After peaking at the beginning of 2020, sales have been steadily declining, with significant drops in between July and September 2020 and, more recently, in July 2022. The United States continue to be the most profitable country, corresponding to 80% of the company's total revenue. Ireland is the only country where the revenue from customers who possess a Loyalty Card is higher than the revenue from customers who do not own one.

### Loyalty Program Success
- In Ireland 53% of the overall revenue comes from customers with a Loyalty Card, while in the United Kingdom and in the United States, those make respectively 31% and 46% of the overall revenue.
- Sales of Loyalty card customers have a high variance, meaning that those customers exhibit inconsistent purchasing behaviour.
- On the other hand, the buying patterns of customers who do not have a Loyalty Card are more regular, indicating that they make consistent, perhaps less frequent but predictable purchases.

### Product Performance
- Robusta has consistently been the least sold coffee type, while Arabica, closely followed by Liberica, are the most popular.
- 2.5 Kg is the most sold size in all three countries, making up 53% of sales in the US and Ireland and 42% in the UK, while 0.2 Kg is the least popular size.
- All roasts perform roughly equally, with the US and the UK preferring Medium, and Ireland preferring Dark.

### Sales Trends Analysis
- Since the company opened, each year we can observe a dip in sales in August, which follows normal holiday seasonality patterns. We also observe dips in January and February, with sales picking up in the following months.
- We can notice that sales are about to hit an all time low, with overall sales barely reaching 400 dollars.
- In the United Kingdom sales have been steadily declining in the past two years, while they've remained stable in Ireland and in the United States.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights and findings above, the stakeholder team should consider the following:
- With Loyalty Cards customers' buying habits being inconsistent, and their  cumulative revenue being less than half of the total, developing the Loyalty Card program is essential. **Offers and discounts should be permanent rather than seasonal, in order to make their purchases more frequent and attract more customers to subscribe.**
- The United Kingdom's Loyalty Card program, in particular, needs to be developed more, since 70% of their revenue comes from non-subscribed customers. **Increasing national advertising on the Loyalty program might bring more subscribers.**
- With 0.2 Kg being the least popular size, options such as **bundles or coffee type flights could increase sales.**
- **Stocks of Arabica and Liberica should be increased**, as they are the most popular coffee types. **Offers on Robusta might incentivise customers to try it.**
- **Special offers and seasonal drinks should be released in the months with lowest revenue**, to raise cashflow. Combining this with targeted and personalised ads to previous customers could help in reducing the loss of revenue.
